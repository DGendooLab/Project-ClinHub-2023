(July 18th, 2023) TCGA stuff uploaded
I have organized my code into a project like this. It seems more decent :)
Now it is capable of:
① Downloading TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-COAD, TCGA-PAAD data.
② Extracting required part of data (experiments, pdata, etc.)
Something in construction:
① The function to fill our experiments and pdata into a MultiAssayExperiment.
