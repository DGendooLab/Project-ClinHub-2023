# Project-ClinHub-2023
A data compendium for genetic profiles - by Hanqing Zhao

-[July 18th, 2023] TCGA stuff uploaded

I have organized my code into a project like this. It seems more decent :)

Now it is capable of:

① Downloading TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-COAD, TCGA-PAAD data.

② Extracting required part of data (experiments, pdata, etc.)

Something in construction:

① The function to fill our experiments and pdata into a MultiAssayExperiment.
